I am able to use the farm truck and horse trailer to haul to go places to ride. The farm also owns the majority of the tack that I use when riding. I am allowed pets. Because my employer also owns another company I have health insurance that they pay a small portion of and a retirement account that they match up to 3%. Some may not sound like a big deal in the corporate environment but for the horse business it’s not bad. Some of my bonus money is based on horses successfully having babies and then how many horses I get pregnant for the next year. This can really fluctuate depending on not only Mother Nature but the goals of the farm. In years past we had 15-20 babies a year.
